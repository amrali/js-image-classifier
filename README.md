# Js Image Classifier from Video

A simple demonstration of TensorFlow using MobileNet convolutional neural network
and feeding the intermediate activations through a K-nearest neighbors classifier.

Through transfer learning we'll make use of the pre-trained MobileNet model to
train it against specific object classes.

## Usage

All dependencies are loaded from `unpkg` CDN, there's nothing to install.

Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser to launch the demo.
